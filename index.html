      <h1>Jollof Spaghetti Recipe</h1>
      <h2>The History of Spaghetti</h2>
      <p class="content">
        While some historians believe pasta originated in Italy, most are
        convinced Marco Polo actually brought it back from his epic voyage to
        China. The earliest known pasta was made from rice flour and was common
        in the east. In Italy, pasta was made from hard wheat and shaped into
        long strands.—bringing this ancient food much closer to modern-day
        spaghetti. However, the earliest Italian version was likely a bit closer
        to vermicelli (a pasta name that translates into English as “little
        worms.”) Spaghetti comes from the word Spago, which translates in
        English to “string,” or “twine.” <br />
        <br />

        In Italy, spaghetti (like all pasta) are generally cooked just to al
        dente (which means “to the tooth.”) to create a slightly chewy texture,
        rather than an overly soft consistency. Because of its shape and
        texture, (not too light or heavy) spaghetti can easily handle a tomato,
        as well as an extra virgin olive oil-based sauce. Spaghetti is
        frequently served with meat or vegetables, and a sauce then topped with
        a generous sprinkling of freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan.

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Blend the tomatoes, onions, and peppers until smooth.</li>
        <li>
          Boil down the tomato sauce on in a pot on medium- high heat until the
          sauce is about half the amount, and has thickened significantly to
          look like a paste. This takes about 15-20 minutes, depending on how
          high the heat is.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be sure to stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from burning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the sauce is reduced, pour in the stock, oil, thyme, curry powder
          and bouillon. At this stage, taste the sauce and adjust for salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add in the spaghetti, pushing it down or breaking it to fit into the
          pot.
        </li>
        <li>Cover and allow to cook for 5 minutes on low-medium heat.</li>
        <li>
          After 5 minutes, the pasta should be soft enough to stir. Stir, turn
          down the heat to low, and allow to cook for another 8-10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 8 minutes, stir, and the pasta should be cooked. If it is not,
          add in a splash (about 1/4 cup) of water and continue to cook for
          another 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you choose to add basil, add it in at this stage, and then serve.
          Enjoy!
        </li>
